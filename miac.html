          In 2022, the Multi-Identity Art Collective (MIAC) was founded to create 
          a warm and inclusive space for artists at UCSD. I had the pleasure of 
          collaborating with MIAC to develop their brand identity and design their 
          website.

          In the year 2018, Valve, the developers of the Counter-Strike series,
          announced that FACEIT would host the thirteenth Global Offensive major.
          It was the first Majojr hosted by FACEIT and the first hosted in the
          United Kingdom. Since  then, FACEIT has consolidated itself as the 
          Esports platform to use, and I developed the new client interface for 
          the app.

          Yusuf Adebayo Grillo posed a thought-provoking question: 
          "When Does Art Become Science and Science Art?" His answer? "Never."
          The distinction between art and science remains clear, with each
          realm tending to operate independently. This separation is also
          evident in social circles, as STEM individuals often gravitate 
          towards one another.

          At UCSD, where a majority of students are STEM scholars, a crucial
          question arises: How can the Multi-Identity Art Collective (MIAC)
          effectively market itself as a welcoming and inclusive organization
          for all students?

        <p class="caption">
          To foster a sense of inclusivity at the Multi-Identity Art Collective 
          (MIAC), I developed a style guide that effectively communicates their 
          message to the UCSD community. This guide highlights MIAC's commitment 
          to welcoming everyone, regardless of artistic skill level or background. 
          The mascot and signature orange and blue color scheme further reinforce 
          their image as a vibrant and inclusive space.

        <p class="caption">
          As Esports can be difficult to stay up-to-date with, a new feature
          called News was introduced. I included a space were articles varying
          from simple game updates to the current state of Esports and possible
          openings for teams can be viewed. This consolidates their whole journey 
          into the industry all in one space, with resources that they can use 
          to help guide them.

        <p class="caption">
          Accessibility and awareness were critical concerns for the MIAC community. 
          Many students were unaware of MIAC events, or when they occurred. To 
          address this challenge, I designed a user-friendly events page that 
          integrated seamlessly with popular calendar apps like Google Calendar. 
          This innovative feature empowered students to easily stay informed about 
          upcoming events and actively participate in MIAC activities.

          Building trust within the community relies heavily on fostering a human 
          connection. Recognizing this, we went beyond simply showcasing MIAC's 
          welcoming mascot on the website.  We incorporated visuals featuring the 
          passionate individuals who are the heart and soul of the organization.

          Not everyone connects with art in the same way, but the need for belonging 
          is a universal human truth. Through design, I strive to create welcoming 
          and engaging experiences for every visitor, fostering a sense of connection. 
          Imagine these visitors transforming into active members, sharing their 
          positive experiences and building a vibrant community through events, 
          workshops, and collaborations. This vision fuels my passion to keep designing 
          &ndash; to be the bridge that connects individuals and fosters a sense of 
          belonging.
