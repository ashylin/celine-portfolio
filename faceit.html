          Many gamers can play competitive games- with some aiming
          to leave the casual scene and develop as professional gamers.
          FACEIT bridges this gap and connects competitive players
          to the Esports scene. I worked on the client interface to ease
          the career journey for professional-seeking individuals.

        <p class="caption">
          In the year 2018, Valve, the developers of the Counter-Strike series,
          announced that FACEIT would host the thirteenth Global Offensive major.
          It was the first Majojr hosted by FACEIT and the first hosted in the
          United Kingdom. Since  then, FACEIT has consolidated itself as the Esports
          platform to use, and I developed the new client interface for the app.

          Creating a brand that elevates and expands what it means
          to be a professional in their craft is harder than it looks.
          It involves thinking about how design elements come together
          to create the impact that you want. Some elements that I
          redesigned involved the font and shape of the iconic orange 
          cursor to set it apart from just being a recolored cursor and 
          establish more of an identity.

          When redesigned an interface that contains many of features,
          we want to make sure that the features usage rates are high.
          The new iteration divides all of the features across two spaces,
          reducing the amount of screen switching a user will have to do
          and allows for lesser used features like Shop to gain more traction.

        <p class="caption">
          As Esports can be difficult to stay up-to-date with, a new feature
          called News was introduced. I included a space were articles varying
          from simple game updates to the current state of Esports and possible
          openings for teams can be viewed. This consolidates their whole journey 
          into the industry all in one space, with resources that they can use 
          to help guide them.

          The world of esports and gaming transcends professional aspirations.
          It's a vibrant community where passionate individuals, from casual
          players to aspiring pros, connect and share their love for the game.
          This shared passion fuels my desire to design spaces that foster strong
          communities &ndash; inclusive environments where everyone feels welcome to compete,
          collaborate, and celebrate their love for gaming.
